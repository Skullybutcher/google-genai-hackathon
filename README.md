# TruthGuard AI üõ°Ô∏è

### The AI Co-Pilot for Navigating Digital Information

TruthGuard AI is a multi-modal "News Context Engine" built as a browser extension for the Gen AI Exchange Hackathon. It goes beyond a simple "fake news detector" by augmenting the power of Google's Gemini models with a suite of verifiable, tool-driven data to provide users with deep, actionable context on any piece of content they encounter online.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Truly Multi-Modal Analysis:** A unified engine to analyze:
    * **Text:** News articles and social media posts.
    * **Video:** Handles YouTube URLs directly and other platforms like X (Twitter) and TikTok via a powerful local transcription pipeline.
    * **Images:** A right-click context menu allows for instant analysis of any image on the web.
* **Source Intelligence Dashboard:** A polished UI that provides an at-a-glance summary of the source's **Political Bias** and **Factuality Rating**.
* **Programmatic Fact-Checking:** Automatically extracts key claims from content and queries the **Google Fact Check Tools API** for third-party, verifiable results.
* **Visual Context Verification:** For images and video frames, the extension provides instant reverse image search capabilities and is built to support deeper forensic analysis.

## üí° Our Innovation: Tool-Augmented AI

Our core principle is to **"never just trust the LLM."** While many tools are simple wrappers around a generative model, TruthGuard AI's innovation is its ability to synthesize an LLM's nuanced understanding with the hard, verifiable data from a suite of specialized tools. This makes our analysis more reliable, defensible, and transparent.
